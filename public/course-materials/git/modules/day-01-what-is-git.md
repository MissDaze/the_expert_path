# Day 1: What is Git and Why It Matters

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- What Git is and why developers use it
- The difference between Git and GitHub
- Basic Git concepts (repositories, commits, branches)
- Why version control is essential for professional development

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain Git to someone who has never heard of it
- Describe the main benefits of using version control
- Understand how Git tracks changes to code
- Know when and why to use Git in your projects

## Core Concepts

### What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** - think of it like a "save game" system for your code. Just like video games let you save your progress at different points, Git lets you save snapshots of your code at different stages.

**Why this matters:** When you're working on a project, you make changes constantly. Sometimes you want to go back to an earlier version. Git makes this possible.

### The Problem Git Solves

Imagine you're writing a document and you make changes:
- Version 1: Original document
- Version 2: Added new section
- Version 3: Removed that section, added different content
- Version 4: Realized Version 2 was better

Without Git, you'd have files named: `document.txt`, `document_v2.txt`, `document_final.txt`, `document_FINAL_FINAL.txt` - a mess!

Git solves this by:
- Keeping ONE file
- Tracking every change made to it
- Letting you jump back to any previous version instantly
- Showing you exactly what changed and when

### Key Git Concepts

**Repository (Repo)**
- A folder where Git tracks all your files and their history
- Contains all versions of all your files
- Think of it as a "project folder with memory"

**Commit**
- A snapshot of your code at a specific moment
- Like saving your game
- Includes what changed, who made the change, and when
- Has a message describing what was changed and why

**Branch**
- A separate line of development
- Lets multiple people work on different features simultaneously
- Like having multiple "save files" that can be merged together later

**Merge**
- Combining changes from different branches
- Bringing separate work together into one version

## Why Version Control Matters for Outlier

Outlier assessments test your ability to:
1. **Understand code history** - Knowing how to view what changed and when
2. **Collaborate properly** - Using branches and merges correctly
3. **Fix mistakes** - Undoing changes when needed
4. **Work professionally** - Following industry-standard workflows

## Common Misconceptions

**"Git is the same as GitHub"**
- Git = The tool that tracks changes (runs on your computer)
- GitHub = A website that stores Git repositories online
- Git is like a camera, GitHub is like a photo album

**"I only need Git for team projects"**
- Even solo developers benefit from Git
- It's a professional standard in all development jobs
- Outlier expects you to know it

**"Git is complicated"**
- Basic Git is simple (we'll prove this!)
- You only need 5-10 commands for most work
- The concepts are logical once explained clearly

## Exercises

### Theory Test 1: Concepts Check
1. What is the main purpose of Git?
2. Explain the difference between Git and GitHub in one sentence
3. What is a commit?
4. Why would a developer use branches?
5. What does "merge" mean in Git?

### Theory Test 2: Real-World Scenarios
1. You're working on a website. You want to add a new feature but also keep the working version safe. How would Git help?
2. You made changes to your code but now realize they were wrong. How does Git help you fix this?
3. You and a friend are working on the same project. How does Git help you work together without overwriting each other's work?

## Key Takeaways

- Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your code
- It lets you save snapshots (commits) of your work
- You can view the entire history of changes
- Branches let multiple people work simultaneously
- Merging combines different branches together
- Git is essential for professional development and Outlier assessments

## Next Steps

In Day 2, you'll set up Git on your computer and make your first commit!
